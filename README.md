# Abstract
Procurement is the process of finding, agreeing terms, and obtaining goods or services from an external source, often via a tendering process. One major drawback of the existing procurement systems in organizations is the tedious paperwork that goes behind each requisition placed by an employee. Ayreon aims at exploiting the powers of the web and developing a digitized way for procuring assets in an organization that are required for the day-to-day operational activities or for some temporary events and so on. This system helps in bringing transparency in the procuring process in large organizations.  Each time an order is placed, the system selects the most optimum vendor from a list of pre-defined vendors on the basis of certain parameters. This prevents partiality on the part of the department manager who might otherwise purchase the same assets from a favored vendor, even if the cost is more. Logging of the order details also provides a mean for easier auditing. The major advantages of this system include remote access, user convenience, invoice verification, and material planning and control. 

# Purchase Head Module
A Purchase Requisition (PR) is filled out by the purchase head and is sent to the department manager for approval. Current status of the PR can also be viewed.

# Department Manager Module
A Requisition Management system maintains all PRs, POs, asset IDs, and the pre-defined set of vendors for all particular assets. An Optimum Vendor Finder system compares quotations received from multiple vendors on the basis of several parameters and finds out the most optimum vendor.

# Store Keeper Module
A Delivery Logging form that is used to register the details of received delivery by the storekeeper.
